    <h2>Description</h2>
       <p>Chapli kebab is a minced meat patty widely popular in Pakistan. Mixed with a blend of spices, ground beef is flattened into patties and shallow-fried until the exterior is charred and flavorful.</p>
       <p>Serve in a bun with pickled red onions or with a side of pita bread. My raita (yogurt dip) recipe makes a great addition.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>cooking spray</li>
           <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
           <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
           <li>1 red onion, finely chopped</li>
           <li>1 tomato, finely chopped</li>
           <li>¼ cup finely chopped cilantro</li>
           <li>¼ cup finely chopped mint</li>
           <li>2 teaspoons ginger-garlic paste</li>
           <li>2 teaspoons coriander seeds, crushed</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
           <li>¾ teaspoon ground cumin</li>

           <li>2 tomato, sliced into rounds</li>
           <li>¼ cup vegetable oil for frying, or more as needed</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Coat a small skillet with cooking spray and place over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beaten egg in the hot skillet until scrambled and set, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine scrambled egg, beef, onion, chopped tomato, cilantro, mint, ginger-garlic paste, coriander seeds, salt, cumin, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl; mix by hand until well combined. Shape mixture into patties. Press a tomato slice into the center of each patty.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cook patties in hot oil in batches until charred, 4 to 6 minutes per side.</li>
        </ol>
